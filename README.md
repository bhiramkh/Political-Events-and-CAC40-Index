# Political-Events-and-CAC40-Index
An empirical analysis examining the impact of French political events on the CAC40 stock market index.

# Project Overview
This project investigates whether French domestic political developments significantly influence the CAC40 index, using event study methodology to analyse price movements and volatility changes to major political events between 2022-2025.

# Objectives
- Quantify the immediate and short-term market response to French political events.
- Analyse volatility changes to measure market uncertainty.
- Determine whether CAC40's global exposure insulates it from domestic politics.
